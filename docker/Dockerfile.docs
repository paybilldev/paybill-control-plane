# NOTE: It's highly recommended to use the new builder, Buildkit. https://docs.docker.com/build/buildkit/
## USAGE:
# Build:        docker build . -f docker/Dockerfile.docs --target production -t docs:latest
# Run:          docker run -p 3000:3000 paybill/docs
# Deploy:       docker push paybill/docs:latest
# Clean build:
#    docker builder prune
#    docker build . -f docker/Dockerfile.docs --target production -t docs:latest --no-cache
