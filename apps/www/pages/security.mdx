### Multi-factor Authentication

Paybill allows users to enable Multi-factor authentication (MFA) on their account.
MFA adds an additional layer of security to your user account, by requiring a second factor to verify your user identity.

### Data Encryption

All customer data is encrypted at rest with AES-256 and in transit via TLS.

Sensitive information like access tokens and keys are encrypted at the application level before they are stored in the database.

### Role-based access control

Read more about [fine grained access controls](/docs/guides/platform/access-control) including Read-Only and Billing-Only access.

### Backups

All paid customer databases are backed up every day.

Point in Time Recovery allows restoring the database to any point in time. Customers from the Pro Plan have access to this feature as an add-on.

### Vulnerability Management

Paybill works with industry experts to conduct regular penetration tests.

In addition to internal security reviews, we use various tools to scan our code for vulnerabilities including [GitHub](https://github.com), [Vanta](https://www.vanta.com/), and [Snyk](https://snyk.io/).

### DDoS Protection

Paybill combats Distributed Denial of Service attacks in several ways to mitigate resource abuse and prevent runaway bills.

In addition to protection at the CDN level via Cloudflare, we employ [fail2ban](https://github.com/fail2ban/fail2ban) to prevent brute force logins. Users can [customize rate limits](/docs/guides/platform/going-into-prod#rate-limiting-resource-allocation--abuse-prevention) for critical API routes and set [spend caps](/docs/guides/platform/cost-control#spend-cap) to prevent surprise bills.
